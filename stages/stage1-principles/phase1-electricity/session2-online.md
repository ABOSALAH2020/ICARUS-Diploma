### 📍 Session Details
- **Stage:** 1 — Principles of Electronics  
- **Phase:** 1 — Electricity & Resistance  
- **Type:** Online Follow-Up  
- **Duration:** 1.5 Hours  
- **Tools:** TinkerCAD Circuits / Falstad Simulator

---

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
By the end of this session, students will:
1. Reinforce understanding of Ohm’s Law through simulation.  
2. Build and simulate **series** and **parallel** circuits digitally.  
3. Compare **theoretical**, **measured**, and **simulated** data.  
4. Record and reflect results in the Engineering Logbook.

## 🧭 Session Flow

### 1️⃣ Recap & Discussion (10 min)
- Review offline results and common challenges.  
- Discuss why current behaves differently in series vs. parallel.

---

### 2️⃣ Simulation Practice (30 min)
**Platform:** [Falstad Circuit Simulator](https://falstad.com/circuit/)  
or [TinkerCAD Circuits](https://www.tinkercad.com/circuits)

Tasks:
1. Rebuild the **series** and **parallel** circuits from the offline session.  
2. Observe current flow (arrows and brightness).  
3. Record simulated voltage and current.

| Parameter | Real Circuit | Simulation | % Difference |
|------------|---------------|-------------|---------------|
| Series Current | 10 mA | 9.8 mA | 2% |
| Parallel Current | 30 mA | 29.5 mA | 1.6% |

---

### 3️⃣ Analysis & Comparison (20 min)
Students compare:
- Theoretical calculations  
- Real measurements  
- Simulated results  

Discuss why differences occur (resistor tolerances, wire resistance, tool precision).

---

### 4️⃣ Quick Quiz (15 min)
1. What happens to current when resistance increases?  
2. Why does current split in parallel circuits?  
3. What does Ohm’s Law tell us about voltage drops?

---

### 5️⃣ Logbook Assignment (15 min)
Complete your **Phase 1 Log Entry**:
- Include simulation screenshots or links.  
- Add measurement comparison tables.  
- Write reflection:
  > “Why is current the same in series but divides in parallel?”

---

## 🧾 Deliverables
- Simulation screenshot or link  
- Real vs. Simulated data table  
- Reflection paragraph  
- Completed logbook entry

---

> “Theory explains it; simulation proves it; practice makes it real.”
