## 🎯 Learning Objectives
By the end of this session, students will:
1. Define voltage, current, and resistance.  
2. Apply **Ohm’s Law (V = I × R)** in a practical circuit.  
3. Build and measure series and parallel circuits.  
4. Use a **multimeter** to measure voltage and current.  
5. Record and interpret results in the Engineering Logbook.

## 🧩 Session Flow

### 1️⃣ Warm-Up: What Is Electricity? (15 min)
- Demonstration: connect an LED directly to a 9V battery → observe LED burn.  
- Ask: *“Why did that happen?”*  
- Introduce **resistors** and their role in limiting current.

---

### 2️⃣ Measurement Practice (30 min)
Students will:
- Measure battery voltage.  
- Measure resistor values (Ω mode).  
- Connect LED + resistor circuit.  
- Measure:
  - Voltage across LED  
  - Voltage across resistor  
  - Total current  

| Component | Voltage (V) | Current (mA) | Resistance (Ω) |
|------------|--------------|---------------|----------------|
| LED | 1.8 | 15 | — |
| Resistor | 7.2 | 15 | 470 |
| **Total** | **9.0** | **15** | — |

---

### 3️⃣ Series vs. Parallel Circuits (60 min)
**Goal:** Observe current and brightness changes.

- **Series:** 3 LEDs + 3 resistors connected in line.  
- **Parallel:** 3 LEDs + 3 resistors, each in its own branch.  
- Measure voltage, current, and brightness in both.

| Circuit Type | Total R (Ω) | Total I (mA) | Brightness | Observation |
|---------------|--------------|---------------|-------------|--------------|
| Series | 900 | 10 | Dim | Shared current |
| Parallel | 300 | 30 | Bright | Current splits |

---

### 4️⃣ The Brightness Challenge (30 min)
**Task:** Adjust resistors to make LEDs equally bright in both circuits.  
- Record configurations in logbook.  
- Take photos of final working circuits.

---

### 5️⃣ Wrap-Up Discussion (15 min)
Ask students:
- Which circuit is more efficient?  
- What’s the role of resistance in controlling current?  
- How does Ohm’s Law explain your results?

---

## 📸 Documentation Task
Each student records:
- Circuit diagrams (hand-drawn or digital)  
- Measurement tables  
- Short reflection:
  > “What I expected vs. what actually happened.”

---

## 🧾 Deliverables
- Breadboard circuits (series + parallel)  
- Measurements table in logbook  
- Reflection paragraph  
- Circuit photo or diagram  

---

> “Real engineering starts when you can measure what you imagine.”
