# 📊 Stage 1 – Phase 1 Assessment
## Electricity & Resistance (Ohm’s Law Applied)

> “In ICARUS, assessment isn’t about grades — it’s about growth.”

---

## 🧾 Overview
Phase 1 combines **hands-on measurement**, **simulation analysis**, and **documentation**.  
Assessment focuses on accuracy, understanding, and reflection.

---

### 🎯 Assessment Goals
- Evaluate students’ grasp of **Ohm’s Law**.  
- Assess ability to **measure**, **analyze**, and **simulate** circuits.  
- Encourage clear and professional **engineering documentation**.
