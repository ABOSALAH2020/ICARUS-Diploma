## 🌟 About the ICARUS Diploma

The **ICARUS Diploma** is a hands-on learning journey that combines **electronics, programming, design, and prototyping** to help you build real working systems — from simple circuits to smart, connected devices.

This diploma is tailored for **Computer Engineering students** (and similar technical fields) who want to move beyond theory and **learn by building**.

Each stage blends:
- **Offline Sessions (2–3 hrs)** → Practical labs and projects  
- **Online Sessions (1–2 hrs)** → Follow-ups, theory expansion, and simulations  
- **Mini Projects** → Small applied builds at the end of each phase  
- **Documentation** → Your personal *Engineering Logbook*  
- **Capstone Project** → Integration of all your skills
